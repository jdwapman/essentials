**Gunrock/Essentials** is a CUDA library for graph-processing designed specifically for the GPU. It uses a **high-level**, **bulk-synchronous**, **data-centric abstraction** focused on operations on vertex or edge frontiers. Gunrock achieves a balance between performance and expressiveness by coupling high-performance GPU computing primitives and optimization strategies, particularly in the area of fine-grained load balancing, with a high-level programming model that allows programmers to quickly develop new graph primitives that scale from one to many GPUs on a node with small code size and minimal GPU programming knowledge.

## Quick Start Guide

Before building Gunrock make sure you have **CUDA Toolkit**[^1] installed on your system. Other external dependencies such as `NVIDIA/thrust`, `NVIDIA/cub`, etc. are automatically fetched using `cmake`.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gunrock/essentials.git
cd essentials
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. 
make sssp # or for all algorithms, use: make -j$(nproc)
bin/sssp ../datasets/chesapeake/chesapeake.mtx
```
[^1]: Preferred **CUDA v11.5.1 or higher** due to support for stream ordered memory allocators (e.g. `cudaFreeAsync()`).

## Getting Started with Gunrock

- [ðŸ‘» (GitHub Template) `essentials` project example](https://github.com/gunrock/applications)
- [Gunrock's documentation](https://github.com/gunrock/essentials/wiki)
- [Gunrock's overview](https://github.com/gunrock/essentials/wiki/Overview)
- [Gunrock's programming model](https://github.com/gunrock/essentials/wiki/Programming-Model)
- [Publications](https://github.com/gunrock/essentials/wiki/Publications) and [presentations](https://github.com/gunrock/essentials/wiki/Presentations)
- [Essentials](https://github.com/gunrock/essentials) versus [Gunrock](https://github.com/gunrock/gunrock)[^2]

[^2]: Essentials is the future of Gunrock. The idea is to take the lessons learned from Gunrock to a new design, which simplifies the effort it takes to **(1)** implement graph algorithms, **(2)** add internal optimizations, **(3)** conduct future research. One example is Gunrock's SSSP, implemented in 4-5 files with 1000s of lines of code versus in essentials, it is a single file with less than 200 lines of code. Our end goal with essentials is possibly releasing it as a `v2.0.0` for Gunrock.
