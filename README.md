**Gunrock/Essentials**[<sup>[1]</sup>](#footnotes) is a CUDA library for graph-processing designed specifically for the GPU. It uses a **high-level**, **bulk-synchronous/asynchronous**, **data-centric abstraction** focused on operations on vertex or edge frontiers. Gunrock achieves a balance between performance and expressiveness by coupling high-performance GPU computing primitives and optimization strategies, particularly in the area of fine-grained load balancing, with a high-level programming model that allows programmers to quickly develop new graph primitives that scale from one to many GPUs on a node with small code size and minimal GPU programming knowledge.

## Quick Start Guide
Before building Gunrock make sure you have **CUDA Toolkit**[<sup>[2]</sup>](#footnotes) installed on your system. Other external dependencies such as `NVIDIA/thrust`, `NVIDIA/cub`, etc. are automatically fetched using `cmake`.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gunrock/essentials.git
cd essentials
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. 
make sssp # or for all algorithms, use: make -j$(nproc)
bin/sssp ../datasets/chesapeake/chesapeake.mtx
```
